# Playing around with Data Structure in Python

This repository represents a review and fun of developing data structures using the 
Python programming language. The main algorithms and structures implemented are:

- Dijkstra;
- Stack;
- Queue;
- Graph;
- Hash table;
- Fibbonacci;
- Heap;
- Dictionary;
- Binary search;
- Bubble sort;
- Graph cycle;
- Hamming;
- Kmeans;
- Linked list;
- Perceptron;
- Inheritance;
- Sets;
- Thread;
- Cipher cesar;
- Tabu backpack;
- PCV;

Also, there is some code using the "pytest" tool for Python code testing purposes.
